                Hey there! I'm Brittany, a cocktail bartender and a lively gogo dancer based 
                in the vibrant city of San Antonio, Texas. With 8 years of experience behind the bar 
                and 2 years lighting up the dance floor, I've honed my skills and passion for bringing 
                joy to people's lives
            </p>
            <p>
                Mixing the perfect cocktail is an art for me, and I take pride in crafting unique flavors
                and experiences for each guest. From classic concoctions to innovative blends, every drink 
                is a story waiting to be told.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not shaking things up at the bar, you'll find me unleashing my energy and rhythm as a gogo
                dancer. Dance is my escape and a way to express the music that moves me
            </p>
            <p>
                Join me for a drink and a dance, and let's make unforgettable memories together!
            </p>
            <p>
            Cheers,
            <br/>
            Brittany
